    Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing Problem (PCVRP) for Qubots.
    
    A fleet of vehicles with uniform capacity must serve a set of customers starting and ending at a common depot.
    Each customer has a demand and a prize. Each customer is served by at most one vehicle.
    In addition to serving customers, the total quantity delivered must be at least a predetermined amount.
    The objectives, in lexicographic order, are:
      1. Minimize the number of trucks used.
      2. Maximize the total prize collected.
      3. Minimize the total distance traveled.
      
    These are combined into one scalar objective:
    
         Objective = (nb_trucks_used * 1e9) - (total_prize * 1e6) + total_distance
    
    A candidate solution is a dictionary with key "routes" mapping to a list of length nb_trucks.
    Each route is a list of customer indices (0-indexed) representing the order in which that truck visits customers.
